#### Learning Goals
* Solidify and demonstrate my understanding of:
DRY JavaScript
* Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
* Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
* Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
* Use my problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust myself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge
